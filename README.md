# :trophy: Daily Coding Challenges

This repository contains the solutions to the coding challenges I do daily.

## :thinking: Why?

I do daily challenges for a few reasons:
* I like to solve puzzles
* Practice is the key to getting better
* Improves my syntax by browsing through the clever one-line solutions 
* Love ~~to destroy the~~ **friendly** competition

## :notebook: Some Notes

If you'd like to compete with me feel free to [follow me](https://www.codewars.com/users/a.sasquach) on there and let me know so I can follow you back.

You might have noticed that there are some repeated challenges. The reason behind this is because I'm using these challenges as a learning tool. Sometime I find an awesome solution to a prior challenge and I'll try to practice it again using different methods just for the heck of it.
