# :trophy: Daily Coding Challenges

This repository is just where I collect my daily coding challenge solutions.

## :thinking: Why?

I do daily challenges for a few reasons:
* I love a good puzzle and this is quicker than a crossword
* Daily practice = Repetition of core concepts
* Love ~~to smash the~~ **friendly** competition
* What better way to deepen my understanding of the language than to use it?

## :notebook: Some Notes

I **love** friendly competition, so if you want to crush me on the leaderboard, feel free to [follow me](https://www.codewars.com/users/a.sasquach) on there and let me know so I can follow you back.

These challenges are a study tool for me, so you'll likely see a lot of repetition of the same challenge. I do this so that I can practice with different methods, or sometimes just for kicks.
